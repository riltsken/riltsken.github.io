 Hi I am Samuel Toriel. I work at Rackspace as a Software Developer on the Cloud Control Panel. Specifically I am on the team that handles our continuous delivery, infrastructure, and some of the developer tools. Removing barriers and making it easier for other developers to get work done is what I like to do.
