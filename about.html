  Hi I am Samuel Toriel. I currently work for FullContact as a DevOps Engineer managing AWS infrastructure and building internal tools. Previously I was with Rackspace and helped build the Cloud Control Panel. Removing barriers and making it easier for other developers to get work done is what I like to do.
