  Hi I am Samuel Toriel. I am currently at <a href="http://www.apto.com/">Apto</a> as a Sr. Software Engineer. Previously I worked for <a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/">FullContact</a> as a DevOps Engineer managing AWS infrastructure and building internal tools. Before that I was with <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> and helped build the <a href="https://mycloud.rackspace.com/humans.txt">Cloud Control Panel</a>. Removing barriers and making it easier for other developers to get work done is what I like to do. You can read more about my experience and accomplishments on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-toriel-4225815">LinkedIn</a> or from my <a href="/resume.txt">Resume</a>.
