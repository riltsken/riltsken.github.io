  Hi I am Samuel Toriel. Currently open to pursuing new opportunities. Previously I worked for FullContact as a DevOps Engineer managing AWS infrastructure and building internal tools. Before that I was with Rackspace and helped build the Cloud Control Panel. Removing barriers and making it easier for other developers to get work done is what I like to do. You can read more about my experience and accomplishments on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-toriel-4225815">LinkedIn</a>.
