        Team workflow using littlechef to manage infrastructure

    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2014</span>
    Littlechef is a library allowing one to use chef without a centralized server orchestrating configuration management. It simplifies the testing and deployment model for managing servers by removing a layer from the stack. What this does is let you provision servers using your cli or programmatically in a similar fashion to ansible.

        Development Pipeline for the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel
      </a>
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2014</span>
    The Cloud Control Panel at Rackspace has ~30 developers split into 8 subteams. All of them are expected to have the ability to modify any part of the system, however, each subteam has some type of specialized knowledge of the product or infrastructure. Our team has a CI/CD pipeline in which we deploy up to 10 times a day (every hour during business hours). This evolved from a pipeline where every merge triggered a deploy.

        Why developers need to attend conferences like Gluecon
      </a>
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">25 May 2014</span>
    At this year's Gluecon, I spoke with many developers from all levels of experience to determine what value these conferences add. The results, while all over the spectrum, speak one clear message: team managers need to send their developers to more conferences. It is one of the best ways to help them grow (and make you as a manager look better).

    Last weekend I had the pleasure of participating in VTHacks as a sponsor and judge representing Rackspace. This was not my first hackathon, but it was definitely one of the largest I have attended.

        Making runbooks more useful by exposing them through monitoring

    <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2014</span>
    As mentioned in a previous post about our server message of the day (motd) we manage enough infrastructure that our team needs ways for being able to share tribal knowledge on how to fix issues. In Particular when we have monitoring alarms that kick off any of our team members should be able to take action on the alarm regardless of level, however, our team operates with so many different technologies it is difficult for any one person to be an expert in all of them.
