+-Beech Valley Solutions - Software Engineer                 April 2021 to Now-+
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Fun Facts
---------

* Third engineer
* Mostly greenfield work
* Wore a lot of hats (startup :))

Description
-----------

Beech Valley itself is a "gig economy" staffing firm for the accounting 
industry. We leverage technology as our differentiator to other staffing firms
in that we can handle 10-100x recruiting load with less interal staff to
manage things. We have a web application that helps supercharge our team to 
recruit and manage consultants while also managing all the projects they 
are working on. Clients also used the app to create and staff their projects.

I was recruited by the CTO to Beech Valley who was a former colleague at
Rackspace. I have touched practically all aspects of the codebase,
infrastructure and processes here because we are a small team and I was an early
engineer. It's a little hard to describe _everything_ I have done but below are 
just a few of the larger efforts.

Most of our internal technology stack is in a monorepo using NX and Typescript.
Our infrastructure lives mostly in AWS on Fargate tasks in ECS.

Projects
--------

Nudge                  This was the first project I lead and implemented.
                       It was named nudge because we wanted to "nudge" the 
                       account managers when they needed to take action on a 
                       project to reduce lead times. I handled the product 
                       requirements and information gathering amongst the team 
                       to whittle down to the features we wanted to implement
                       and then... executed! We had three phases which we built:
                       
                       1. Layered alerting on Projects in the app
                       2. Client digest emails to prod them to take action
                       3. Overdue actions (emails) that consultants needed to
                       respond to.

Candidate Pipeline     Second project I lead. We needed to streamline our
                       process for recruiting consultants. The previous one
                       required managing changes between multiple systems and 
                       everyone was handling it differently. I suggested
                       combining the systems and using one interface in our app
                       to manage the whole process. When this project completed
                       lead times for recruiting consultants went from
                       an inconsistent 25+ days to a consistent 12 days.  
                       Additionally we had large queues of candidates but with
                       the new system we were able to make sure every candidate 
                       was responded to. I dubbed this system "Inbox Zero".

Continuous Deployment  I was able to convince the team to practice continuous
                       deployment through automated daily deploys. Previously 
                       the team was deploying ad-hoc.

Heroku To AWS          When Heroku declared it's security incident In April 2022
                       the CTO and I decided we needed to accelerate our plan
                       to migrate to AWS (which we had done no work for yet). 
                       By the end of July 2022 we completed our migration to 
                       AWS. We had a multi-account architecture and used AWS
                       Fargate + ECS to manage our app. We migrated our 
                       API + Worker + RDS + Elasticsearch over along with all 
                       our monitoring using Datadog. This migration was done by 
                       just myself and the CTO.

Monitoring + Security  I took charge of managing almost all of our monitoring
                       using Datadog. I setup all the dashboards for making sure
                       we had data around application + datastore load and 
                       performance. Because we were using GraphQL it was 
                       incredibly important for us to use APM tracing 
                       allowing us to pinpoint any api bottlenecks.

                       In addition, we used the security offerings from Datadog
                       in which I setup all the Cloud SIEM and AWS CloudTrail 
                       logging to message slack when any security signals 
                       occured. We had custom signals for things like
                       S3 usage and SSH access.

+-Ibotta - Staff Engineer                          February 2020 to April 2021-+
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Fun Facts
---------

* Joined a team with lots of legacy code and few if any original owners
* First time working with GraphQL
* No manager for the first 6 months because they were let go and had to find 
a new one.

Description
-----------

Primarily worked in the domain of serving Content for Ibotta consumers. 
As a backend team we focused on storing internal data, applying personalization 
from customer interactions and serving it through a GraphQL API for Ibotta's 
external facing applications (Mobile & Web). Much of my day to day consisted
of reviewing code from external teams wanting to add new api endpoints and
ensuring performance, accuracy, and errors were in our allowed internal SLA's

* Maintained and scaled a B2C facing GraphQL API which operated at
~2000 requests/s. During peak busy seasons we manually scaled up the data and 
compute planes to properly handle large traffic spikes.

* After a mandate from the company that we needed to reduce spend I lead 
and organized team infrastructure costs in a shared spreadsheet month to month
which allowed us to identify and reduce costs YoY in the low six figure range 
(mostly overprovisioned datastores) for our specific team.

* When joining the team they deployed sparingly because they had an issue with 
response times spiking. Apparently this had been going on for 9 months+. I was
able to research, identify, and remediate this bug which required me working
with the infrastructure team (we were an app team) to prove that the nginx
loadbalancer we were using in kubernetes was the cause. The fix was to upgrade
the nginx version + use a different loadbalancing algorithm because it 
had a bug (:

* Introduced Typescript into Ibotta's 2nd largest codebase and provided a 
migration guide on how to move js parts to ts. The goal of Typescript was to
help reduce bugs due to unknown and poorly understood data shapes from 
developers who were no longer at the company.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
+-Percolate - Engineering Manager in Infrastructure  May 2019 to February 2020-+
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Fun Facts
---------

* Percolate was acquired by Seismic Softare.
* First time dealing with SOC 2 Compliance.
* Learned kubernetes as an operator.
* Learned CFEngine which I have purged from my brain since then.

Description
-----------

While my tenure at Percolate was shorter than most my impact was still
fairly strong. I took over the "team" that managed the legacy infrastructure
which was managed by CFEngine (only one person in the company understood how
it worked). They had 1000+ legacy nodes that were not using autoscaling groups
which required a lot of hands on TLC. My role was in support of another team
trying to migrate to Kubernetes as fast as possible while myself and the other
individual pretty much kept the infrastructure running.

During this period I uncovered a particularly annoying networking bug in 
Kubernetes causing lots of conntrack failures for apps connecting to datastores.
There are many layers here but in concise terms we can say the SNAT 
implementation was the culprit which we were able to change.

The "team" itself evolved and eventually after migrating to Kubernetes I started
helping manage the datastores, security and helping with SOC 2 auditing. The 
team changed and I had 2 data engineers under me where we managed to automate a
25 RDS migration to the new Kubernetes VPC with 0 issues and minimal downtime.

+-Apto - Senior Engineer + Engineering Manager     November 2016 to March 2019-+
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Fun Facts
---------

* First time managing a team.
* First time building a mobile app deployed to both Apple + Android.
* Started up their AWS Cloud infrastructure from scratch using Terraform.

Description
-----------

During my time at Apto I started as a software engineer and eventually lead a 
product team consisting of 4 software engineers and 1 qa engineer. During my 
time managing I still helped with architecture, tricky technical bits, 
and infrastructure. As manager I was involved in 1:1s, engineer growth,
hiring and dealing with everything that comes with that in a messy startup 
environment.
